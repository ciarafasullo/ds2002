Reflection:

  In this assignment, I further developed my skills of effectively utilizing CSV files and Pandas DataFrames to perform data analyses. Reading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame allowed me to access and manipulate this dataset easily, performing tasks such as filtering players by minutes played and grouping players by their school. I worked on my basic aggregation function skills like summing total points, finding top players in various categories, and ordering data. The ability to filder, group, and manipulate data is key for data analysis, and I can see how these skills will be useful in any data science project moving forward.

  The most challenging aspect of this assignment was calculating correlations, as that was a skill I have never used before. Initially, learning how to properly lean and structure the data to avoid missing or irrelevant entries was a road block. Calculating the correlation coefficient required familiarity with how to handle statistical operations in pandas, which is something I have limited experience with. This experience has helped me become more comfortable with both the statistical analysis side as well as presenting that data in a visually-appealing and easy-to-read manner.

  Analyzing ACC basketball statistics can definitely be applicable for working with real-world datasets across a variety of fields. For example, grouping players by school and comparing their total points scored could also translate well into grouping customers by demographic in a business context. Additionally, investigating correlations between variables, like field goal percentage and win shares, can be applied to determining relationships between business metrics. The skills developed in this project, such as grouping and filtering, will translate to any domain where data-driven decision making is relevant.
